# Executive Summary

## Overview of Findings

The LastMile Store Sales Analysis shows total sales of $733,215 and profit of $93,439 across 693 customers. Sales performance varies by region and product category, with strong concentration in a few key states and high-value items. California leads all states $146,388, followed by New York at $93,923, and Washington at $65,540. Most remaining states fall below $30,000 in sales, showing a large gap between top and mid-tier markets. Several states, including Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, and Wyoming, recorded $0 in sales. This suggests either no recorded transactions or missing data. Customer activity shows that orders are widely distributed but heavily concentrated in high-population states, indicating that both demand and regional market size strongly influence total revenue. Product categories also show large differences, with phones generating $105,341 while the lowest category, Fasteners, generated only $858. These findings highlight where the company is performing well and where growth opportunities exist.

# Recommendations

- Focus marketing and inventory on top-performing categories: Phones, Chairs, Binders, Storage, Copiers, and Tables.
- Expand mid-performing items into strong markets to raise their sales above the $43,130 average.
- Run promotions or bundles for low-selling categories to clear slow-moving inventory.
-  Strengthen presence in high-opportunity states such as California, New York, Washington, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.
-  Investigate states with $0 sales (Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Wyoming) for possible supply chain issues or missing distribution.
-  Use targeted seasonal campaigns from August-November, when sales naturally peak.
